Name: Amtullah Naalwala
Comments: Project was actually very easy, I just made the grave mistake of not reading the client.cc file so it took me alot longer to figure on identity encoding and chunked encoding than it should've. The function in client.cc was very helpful in that sense. 
Time: a week and a half, about 4 to 5 hours a day.
